// Design a class employee of an organization. An employee has a name, empid, and salary. 
// Write the default constructor, a constructor with parameters (name, empid, and salary) and methods 
// to return name and salary. Also write a method increaseSalary that raises the employeeâ€™s salary 
// by a certain user specified percentage. Derive a subclass Manager from employee. 
// Add an instance variable named department to the manager class. 
// Supply a test program that uses theses classes and methods.
